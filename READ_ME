# What is Qiskit? :
Qiskit is open-source software for working with quantum computers at the level of circuits, pulses, and algorithms. Additionally, several domain specific application API’s exist on top of this core module.

The central goal of Qiskit is to build a software stack that makes it easy for anyone to use quantum computers, regardless of their skill level or area of interest; Qiskit allows one to easily design experiments and applications and run them on real quantum computers and/or classical simulators. Qiskit is already in use around the world by beginners, hobbyists, educators, researchers, and commercial companies.

# Tasks Given :
Code based -
• If you are more comfortable with code:
1. Create a program that builds an oracle for a given string (e.g. given 01101, will
return a QuantumCircuit that inverts the phase of the state |01101> and leaves all
other states unchanged.
2. Tackle an open issue in the Qiskit Terra repo.
3. Create a program that builds an oracle circuit from a problem (like the Phase
Oracle class does in the previous page). Assess how the size of your circuits
grow with the size of the problem.
4. Try making a quantum game.
